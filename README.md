# dvd-library

For this project, I took an agile approach
I followed the CRUD methodology

I started by designing, creating and then testing the different CURD elements, implementing them one at a time and testing after each implementation.

Starting with what I believe would be the most difficult method to implement, addDvd(). Then repeated the step mentioned above and for each other method.
